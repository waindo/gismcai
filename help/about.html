<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">
This dashboard mapping application designed to display Geographic Information 
System (GIS) data available at MCA-Indonesia. The main objectives are, firstly, 
to understand the working area of MCA-Indonesia project. Secondly, to support 
the technical reviews of renewal energy and natural resources management project 
proposal through visual assessment using available GIS data.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
application is developed using ArcGIS API for JavaScript and Dojo. Public can 
access the application using several browsers including Chrome, Mozilla, and 
Internet Explorer. Stable and fast minimum 512 kbps internet connection is 
needed to access the application. Users who are not able to display the data due 
to internet connection problem may use this link to see the snapshot of the 
application.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">To 
enhance the performance (loading speed) of the application, not all 
MCA-Indonesia GIS data are presented in this application. Current version groups 
GIS data/layer to several categories, which are sorted alphabetically. Those 
categories include: MCA-Indonesia working area, Administrative, Carbon Project, 
Energy, Forestry, Hydrology, Infrastructure, Landcover, Landscape, Land 
Degradation, Landuse (Spatial Planning), Permits (Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Mining), Socio Economic, and Topography. Spatial data in two provinces are 
available in this current version, i.e. Jambi and West Sulawesi, although not 
all the layers are available for the latter.</font></p>
<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">All data 
accessible for public can be found at MCA-Indonesia GIS Server. Users who are 
interested to access GIS data, which are not currently displayed, may request 
the data to MCA-Indonesia. We will respond the request considering the 
availability of the requested data in our geodatabase, copyright issue, and 
performance of the application. </font></span>
